Group Assignment 1  Incremental Learning  on Large Data      Learning objective:  Estimating a feed-forward neural network on data that is larger than what can be held in a typical computer’s RAM.   Data:  All data is contained in pricing.csv. The data is copyrighted and confidential.   One line in the data represents a product selling on the company’s e-commerce website. If a product goes out-of-stock and then becomes in-stock again a new line is created in the data for that product   • sku: stock keeping unit • price: the price of the product on the website • quantity: total quantity sold  • order: identifies the nth time the product was in-stock and selling on the website • duration: how long the product appeared on the site before going out-of-stock • category: product category  Note 1: All categorical variables are integer encoded (not necessarily consecutively). All numeric variables are divided by a constant.  Variables  Input variables • sku • price • order • duration • category  Response variable:  • quantity    

Deliverables:  - A feed forward neural network that predicts quantity sold. The neural network should have three hidden layers, with sigmoid activation. The model should be learned incrementally: read in one record (or a mini-batch), update the model, repeat. Among other things, the better the model in terms of R2 on pricing_test.csv the higher your grade:  𝑅!=1−	∑(𝑦"−	𝑦#))!∑(𝑦"−	𝑦+)!  - Do not use pricing_test.csv for training or tuning - A learning curve: a plot with on the x-axis the number of instances learned, and on the y-axis the moving average of the MSE. - A plot showing variable importances - Multiple partial dependence plots - Information on RAM usage  - Information on training time - Runbook file - Statement of who did what to show contributions of all team members  Format:  - Code (Python and shell is allowed, no notebooks) and Presentation (pdf or PowerPoint) - Submit as an archive (e.g., zip). Have your name and group number in the folder name and all file names.
