CONTRIBUTION STATEMENT - Group Assignment 1
================================================================================
Group Number: 7
Course: BZAN 554 
Assignment: Incremental Learning on Large Data

Approach:
Each team member independently developed their own neural network 
implementation, experimenting with different architectures, feature 
engineering, and hyperparameters. We then compared results and combined 
the best findings into the final model.
