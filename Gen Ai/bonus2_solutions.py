How do you drive a car?

# flan-t5 answer:
drive it with your hands on the steering wheel.

# ChatGPT answer:
Driving a car involves several basic steps, but before getting started, make sure you’re in a safe and legal position to drive (i.e., having a valid driver’s license and being in an appropriate environment like a road or parking lot).

Here’s a general step-by-step guide to driving a car with an automatic transmission (it’s a bit simpler than a manual, so we’ll start with that):

### 1. **Get In and Set Up**
- **Adjust your seat** so you can reach the pedals comfortably. Your knees should be slightly bent when pressing the gas and brake pedals.
- **Adjust your mirrors** (rearview and side mirrors) so you have good visibility around the car.
- **Fasten your seatbelt**—always a must!
- Make sure your car is in "Park" (P) mode.

### 2. **Starting the Car**
- Press the brake pedal with your foot.
- Turn the key or press the start button (depending on your car).
- Make sure the car is idling smoothly before you move.

### 3. **Engage the Gear**
- Keep your foot on the brake, then move the gear shifter from "Park" (P) to "Drive" (D) if you're moving forward. If you’re backing up, shift into "Reverse" (R).
- Be aware that in "Drive," the car will start moving forward as soon as you take your foot off the brake.

### 4. **Starting to Move**
- Gently lift your foot off the brake while gradually pressing the gas pedal with your right foot.
- The car will begin to move forward.
- Be cautious and start slow, especially if you’re new to driving.

### 5. **Steering and Keeping Control**
- Use your hands to grip the steering wheel at about 9 o'clock and 3 o'clock positions (like the hands of a clock).
- Keep the car centered in your lane by gently steering left or right as needed.

### 6. **Braking and Stopping**
- To stop, slowly press the brake pedal with your right foot.
- Start braking early enough to give yourself plenty of time to stop without slamming on the brakes.
- When coming to a complete stop, make sure your car is in "Park" (P) when you’re done.

### 7. **Turning and Using Signals**
- Use your turn signals (or indicators) to let other drivers know which direction you are going. 
- Always signal well in advance before turning or changing lanes.

### 8. **Parking**
- When you park, make sure the car is in "Park" (P), and engage the parking brake (if necessary).
- If you’re parallel parking or backing into a space, check all your mirrors and be aware of your surroundings to avoid obstacles.

### 9. **Driving Etiquette**
- Follow the rules of the road, like obeying traffic signs, stopping at red lights, and yielding to pedestrians.
- Maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and use your brakes early if you see the traffic slowing down.

Does that all make sense? If you're practicing or have specific concerns, I can offer more tailored advice!



# Example of prompt where flan-t5 is has a similar quality response as ChatGPT:
How many days are there in a year?

# flan-t5 answer:
365

# ChatGPT answer:
There are **365 days** in a standard year. However, every 4 years, there’s a leap year, which has **366 days** instead of 365. The extra day is added to the month of **February**, making it have 29 days instead of the usual 28. 

The leap year accounts for the fact that it actually takes the Earth about **365.25 days** to orbit the Sun, so the extra day helps to keep the calendar year synchronized with the Earth's revolutions.

Do you need any more details on leap years or how they work?
