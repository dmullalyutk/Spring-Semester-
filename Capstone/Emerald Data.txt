Data 

Short Form ? 


Number AMR (remember that they didn't want to differentiate) 
only available for meter not combined meter
could we find this data for combined meter 


AMI - same thing, also what is the difference 

Total number of meters 

Look at relationships between different meter ratios ---> energy served 

significance of daily digital access and direct load control

customer name and id missing 


could we use current customer meter data to accurately predict current pickup data and would that allow us to use combined meter data to predict theoretical pickup numbers for non emerald customers. Then we can compare possible pickup gain per region



AMR to AMI transition (who is upgrading and why)


map strong vs weak penetration, overlay with meterage, find target rich areas

time series ideas 
what kind of customers are growing/shrinking 

leading indicators? 
seasonality? 

PNL: 

Map for how to read PNL 

Revenue per product unit 

Gross Profit 

Operating Expenses 30 -40 % goal 

Field decom and field service harder to estimate 

help with putting a new facility would affect PNL

Mix in territory estimate ~ assume from

find a building maybe, 


To predict, populations, age of equipment, 

census data on demographics


master the data: 

complications: 

Service Area, utility id linked to ID

Small problem first - state,
