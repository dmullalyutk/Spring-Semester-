Data 

Short Form ? 


Number AMR (remember that they didn't want to differentiate) 
only available for meter not combined meter
could we find this data for combined meter 


AMI - same thing, also what is the difference 

Total number of meters 

Look at relationships between different meter ratios ---> energy served 

significance of daily digital access and direct load control

customer name and id missing 


could we use current customer meter data to accurately predict current pickup data and would that allow us to use combined meter data to predict theoretical pickup numbers for non emerald customers. Then we can compare possible pickup gain per region
